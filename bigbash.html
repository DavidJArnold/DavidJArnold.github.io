        <!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->
        <p>This page details my study of Big Bash cricket using data sourced from
            <a href="https://cricsheet.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">cricsheet.org</a>. The code used for this
            project can be found in the
            <a href="https://github.com/DavidJArnold/CricketStats/" rel="external" target="_blank">CricketStats</a> GitHub repository.</p>
        <p>I used ball-by-ball data from 414 games to study how innings progress from start to finish, as well as how Big Bash cricket has changed over it's 10 seasons.</p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>This investigation used three technologies: Python, SQL, and Tableau. I used Python to parse the yaml files from CricSheet, extract and format the information, and then insert that data in a MySQL database.
            The database has three tables, one for match information, one for information about each ball, and one for information about each wicket. The database layout and columns are shown to the right.
        </p>
    <p> I used MySQL workbench to directly query the database for exploratory research purposes, and once I found useful and interesting queries I wrote them into a Python file. The Python script extracted, processed, and saved output data in csv files, which I imported into Tableau to create the interactive dashboard that can be seen below.</p>

        <p>A concise summary of some of the interesting findings from this project is shown the the Tableau dashboard embedded below. Information is separated by season of the Big Bash and over.

        <p>The top-left panel shows average run-rate per by, separated by season. It is quite clear that across all seasons, teams start their innings quickly, then slow down and gradually build up momentum to finish with some high-scoring overs. The large drop in scoring after the first few overs is due to the end of the powerplay, a period at the start of the innings where the fielding team is restricted so runs are easier to score. A few specific things can be seen from this plot:
        <ul><li>For Season 10, the initial powerplay was reduced from 6 overs, as it had been in previous seasons, to 4 overs. The effect can be seen clearly by isolating the Season 10 curve, where the drop happens after the 4th over.</li>
        <li>Scoring was slower in the first few seasons (lighter lines), particularly at the start and end of the innings.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The top-right panel shows the proportion of wickets in a season that fell in each over, measured against the average uniform rate. A decreasing value means teams are losing wickets at less than the average rate, while an increasing value means they are losing wickets more quickly than average. The trend is quite clear, and once again some interesting variations can be seen:
        <ul>
            <li>In Season 1, teams were more protective of their wickets early in the innings, with wickets falling at a significantly slower rate. Their innings were less balanced---tending to lost many wickets late, presumably while taking extra risk to score more quickly.</li>
        <li>As the seasons have progressed, teams seem to have become comfortable losing wickets at a faster rate. Despite this, it is still around the same point in the innings, roughly the 13th over, where they start to dramatically increase risk levels.</li>
    </ul>
        </p>


    <p>The bottom panel compares run-rate against wicket proportion for each over in each season. The symbols get darker as the overs progress, and the symbols are different for each season. This is a particularly interesting plot because it helps visualise the risk/reward tradeoff as mentioned previously. Scoring more runs in an over (moving higher on the plot) correlates to an increases risk of dismissal (moving to the right on the plot). Some of the trends identified previously can be seen here as well, the darker symbols to the rop-right of the plot correspond to the late overs, where teams take big risks to score runs quickly.

        You can select individual seasons to get a closer look at the data. In later seasons, the maximum wicket proportions actually fall while the maximum run-rates stay fairly stable. This shows that batters have been able to evolve their approach to more efficiently score runs quickly at the end of the innings. Put another way, they get more value for taking risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way Big Bash cricket is played has definitely changed over the seasons. Batters have adapted to the extremely short format and have learned to place less value on their wickets and more value on consistent scoring through the innings. They are also more able to score runs quickly at the end of the innings without taking as many risks.
